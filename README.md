## Description
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

The aim of the project was to provide a fun and interactive way to practice Python programming concepts as part of my AI Core training course.

Through this project, I learned how to create an interactive command line game, manage game state, handle user input, and implement basic game logic.

## Installation
To install and run the Hangman, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/garypolzin/hangman139.git
    ```

2. **Open the repository in VS Code or another programming package**

3. **Ensure you have Python installed.**

## Usage
To play the Hangman Game, run the following command in your terminal:

```
python milestone_4.py
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to guess the letters of the hidden word - you have a limited number of lives.
